# Pipelined Processor

## Introduction
The launch of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) in 2011 has allowed an increase in the use of RISC-V in many processors, microcontrollers, among others. Due to its high versatility besides, it is an open ISA (allows further expansion of the instruction set by third parties). Designed by a non-profit foundation, known as the RISC-V FoundationÂ¹. In this project, we show a 3-stage processor design (Fetch, Execute and Memory & WriteBack), as well as the application of the Pipeline technique to the processor. The project will consist of the following sections: Processor, which will show the design of the processor and its most important characteristics; Pipelined Processor, explanation of the Pipeline technique applied to the processor; Formal Verification, this section presents the verification applied to each block of the processor in addition to the TOP circuit; Example Execution, examples of some programs in Assembly and C that are executed in the designed processor; and finally, Conclusions and References.
